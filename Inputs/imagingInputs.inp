.TRUE.          !Set true scattering
.TRUE.          !enable imaging of ingoing beam with scattered particles? set false for only scattering
.TRUE.          !include testing modules? set true to obtain angle distributions etc.
.TRUE.          !write images? set true to enable writing of images to files.
3.0D0          !Relative sensitvity of the scattered molecules. higher number means 'brighter' scattered particles.
